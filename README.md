# pyjac

This is the github repo that contains our project for the PyJaC Hackathon event. The prompt we'll be using is as follows:
> Compute different linear algebra algorithms (determinant, Gram-Schmidt, gaussian elimination, etc.) with high precision

# List of algorithms

This is a list of algorithms we plan on implementing a solution for in our program:
- Determinant
- Vector operations (cross product, dot product, scaling, etc.)
- Gaussian elimination
- Complex number operations (add, subtract, multiply, etc.)
- Finding the inverse of a matrix
