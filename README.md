# pyjac

This is the github repo that contains our project for the PyJaC Hackathon event. The prompt we'll be using is as follows:
> Compute different linear algebra algorithms (determinant, Gram-Schmidt, gaussian elimination, etc.) with high precision

# List of algorithms

This is a list of algorithms we've managed to implement:
- Determinant
- Vector operations (cross product, dot product)
- Gaussian elimination
- Finding the inverse of a matrix
- Finding the RREF of a matrix
 
Here is also a list of algorithms/actions we planned on implementing but couldn't in the time frame:
- More vector operations (scaling, addition, etc.)
- Complex number operations (addition, multiplication, converting between standard and polar form, etc.)
